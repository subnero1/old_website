		<p>Communicating, navigating and monitoring underwater are challenging problems that entail a number of hurdles specific to the domain. Adopting land based technologies like Wi-Fi™ &amp; GPS is not possible as they use electromagnetic waves that are rapidly absorbed in water. Communication, the key enabler for networking, navigation and sensing, requires a high level of flexibility over physical layer signaling, sensing as well as granular control over timing (transmission &amp; reception).
		</p>
		<h2>Software-defined Modem</h2>
		<p>
		The software-defined Subnero Underwater Modem provides a flexible platform for a variety of underwater networks and applications. With substantial computing power packed into a compact form factor, users are able to implement and deploy complex algorithms in the modem, hence allowing robust communication between underwater nodes as well as driving the innovation of new protocols and applications. The modem provides options for customization and extension at many levels, allowing network protocols as well as physical layer algorithms to be implemented and tested easily.

UnetStack is an embedded Java/Groovy implementation of the UnetStack specifications based on the open-source fjåge lightweight agent framework. It provides a basic set of agents that allow an underwater network to be deployed. Designed for extensibility, UnetStack allows additional agents for optimized protocols to be rapidly developed, tested and deployed. The stack can easily be integrated with most underwater modems.
