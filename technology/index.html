		<p>Communicating, navigating and monitoring underwater is a challenging problem and entails a number of hurdles specific to the domain. Adopting land based technologies like Wi-Fiâ„¢, GPS is not possible as they use electromagnetic waves that are rapidly absorbed in water. Another possible solution is to use acoustics, which comes with a variety of challenges such as low-bit rate, low bandwidth, loss from echoes etc. Communications, the key enabler for networking, navigation and sensing, require a high level of flexibility over physical layer signaling, sensing as well as granular control over timing (transmission & reception).
