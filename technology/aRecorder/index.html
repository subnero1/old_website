		<p>Subnero aRecorder is a multi-hydrophone broadband data acquisition system designed for extended deployments in marine environments. 
		It is designed to support 1 or more hydrophones with an aggregate sampling rate of up to 500kSa/s. The aRecorder comes with factory settable low pass and high pass filters.
		With the ability to schedule varying-duration deployments, aRecorder allows rapid environmental assessment where no previous data might have been available. it is designed for minimal manual intervention as well as ease of deployment & retrieval.
		Additional sensors such as GPS, depth sensors, compass etc. can easily be integrated to the system, catering to a variety of applications.
