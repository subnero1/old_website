	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>
	Subnero provides high-performance flexible solutions for underwater communication networks. <br><br> 

	The solutions not only include a state-of-the-art software-defined underwater modem, but also a highly customizable network stack (www.unetstack.net) that adapts to a variety of environments and applications. <br><br> 

	While the stack runs a variety of optimized underwater network protocols, it also provides engineers and researchers with the flexibility to modify or specify new protocols.  An underwater network simulator complements the modem and stack, by providing an easy-to-use test environment in which network configurations and protocols can be tested prior to field experiments or deployments.  The simulator is fully compatible with the modem and stack, allowing end-to-end testing to manage the risks and reduce costs of at-sea testing.  In real-time mode, the simulator provides an accurate experience for operators and field engineers.  In discrete event mode, the simulator allows high throughput performance simulation worth weeks of real-time within minutes.  In addition to networking technology, Subnero also provides solutions of mobile data collection, underwater network management, data aggregation and analytics, and customization services.
