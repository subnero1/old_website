	Subnero’s solution suite comprises the following elements,

	<h2>Underwater Networking</h2>
	The Subnero underwater modem provides a flexible platform for a variety of underwater networks and applications. With substantial computing power packed into a compact form factor, users are able to implement and deploy complex algorithms in the modem, hence allowing robust communication between underwater nodes as well as driving the innovation of new protocols and applications.
	The modem provides options for customization and extension at many levels, allowing network protocols as well as physical layer algorithms to be implemented and tested easily.

	<h2>Underwater Navigation</h2>
	Subnero’s solution involves flexible acoustic communication nodes and intelligence, to form a GPS-like infrastructure underwater to aid underwater vehicles in self-localization as well as communication. The nodes can be used as beacons for underwater position estimation, and could transparently relay information to allow the vehicles to communicate over long distances, to other vehicles, underwater installations or surface nodes. These nodes may be easily dropped into water in an area of operation. Once in water, the nodes will self-organize into an Underwater Positioning Network (UPN). This network may then be accessed by Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) to estimate their location and navigate efficiently, and to transparently relay information to a remote operator, other AUVs, or underwater sensor installations. 

	<h2>Monitoring & Sensing</h2>
	To safeguard and manage freshwater resources, effective water sampling techniques over space and time are needed to detect and monitor contamination of local water bodies. Typical manual sampling is too labor-intensive and slow to capture these events.

	Fixed sensing buoys are able to provide real-time data but incapable of providing spatial coverage. Autonomous vehicles (AUVs) are able to provide spatial coverage, but are economically and logistically expensive to operate.

	Subnero's solution contains scalable, low cost and minimally propelled autonomous underwater platforms that can carry in-situ water quality probes and operates with little logistics. These mobile nodes will be equipped with navigation, sensing and real time data transmission capabilities. It can autonomously execute missions provided by users and perform vertical profiling at points of interest. Users are then able to access the data and control the missions in real-time.

	Subnero provides professional deployment services and operational support for its clients.
