	<h2>Underwater Networking</h2>

	<p>The Subnero underwater modem provides a flexible platform for a variety of underwater networks and applications. With substantial computing power packed into a compact form factor, users are able to implement and deploy complex algorithms in the modem, hence allowing robust communication between underwater nodes as well as driving the innovation of new protocols and applications.
	The modem provides options for customization and extension at many levels, allowing network protocols as well as physical layer algorithms to be implemented and tested easily.</p>

	<h2>Underwater Navigation</h2>
	<p>Subneroâ€™s solution involves flexible acoustic communication nodes and intelligence to form a GPS-like infrastructure underwater, aiding underwater vehicles (AUVs) in self-localization as well as communication. The nodes can be used as beacons for position estimation and can transparently relay information. This allows vehicles to communicate over long distances to other vehicles, underwater installations and/or surface nodes. These nodes may be easily dropped into water in an area of operation. Once in water, the nodes self-organize into an Underwater Positioning Network (UPN). This network can then be accessed by AUVs to estimate their location, navigate and communicate effectively.</p>

	<h2>Water Monitoring &amp; Sensing</h2>
	<p>To safeguard and manage freshwater resources, effective spatial and temporal water sampling techniques are needed. Typical manual sampling used by environmental and water utility agencies is very labor-intensive and usually too sparse to capture contamination events in a timely manner. Fixed sensing buoys are able to provide real-time data but incapable of providing spatial coverage. Traditionally available autonomous vehicles are able to provide spatial coverage, but are economically and logistically expensive to operate.</p>

	<p>Subnero's solution contains scalable, minimally propelled autonomous platforms that can carry in-situ water quality probes and operate with minimal manual support. These mobile nodes are equipped with navigation, sensing and real-time data transmission capabilities. They can autonomously execute missions provided by users and perform vertical profiling of the water column at points of interest. Users are then able to access the data and refine missions in real-time.</p>

	<p>Subnero provides professional deployment services and operational support for its clients.</p>
